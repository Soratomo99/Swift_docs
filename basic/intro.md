# Swift
Introduce Swift language programing

## What is Swift
Swift is a relatively young language, having launched only in 2014. This means it doesn’t have a lot of the language cruft that old languages can suffer from. Being such a new programming language means that Swift leverages all sorts of new ideas built upon the successes – and sometimes mistakes – of older languages.

## Why using Swift
 It’s a safe, fast, and interactive programming language that combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom from the wider Apple engineering culture and the diverse contributions from its open-source community. And Swift can builds applications run on Apple devices.
